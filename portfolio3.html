                <p>What makes a interface "tick"? Even the most common devices - those that we take completely for
                    granted - rely on effective interfaces to function properly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I set out to conduct a user analysis for on of the most ubiquitous interfaces used today: the AC
                    control unit. I wanted to find out the types of users that use this interface, and to glean out the
                    major problems faced by those users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, I had the goal of creating a definitive set of user personas for the AC unit. This
                    would allow future designers to pinpoint the exact needs of users as they created new iterations of
                    this interface.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project, I observed usage of a control panel for an AC unit in private video
                    gaming/boarding gaming rooms at a community recreation center. This unit experiences heavy usage and
                    is the perfect target for conducting a user analysis study.

                            off when we entered the game room, and they let me know that they were hot when we walked
                            in. I always look after my kids’ comfort. They were running around so I needed to adjust the
                            temperature quickly so I could turn my attention back to them before they started drawing on
                            the walls or something. </blockquote>

                            A button that consolidates the "Mode" and "Fan" button essentially to create a seamless and
                            integrated experience for users. Modern day AC units should support this feature. There’s a
                            lot of fluff on the newer AC units, which I really like and don’t mind at all, but the auto
                            button is something that every AC needs.</blockquote>

                    <br>
                    <li> The user pulled out her phone and used the light functionality on her
                        phone to illuminate the unlit buttons (which were partially shaded by the covering of the
                        interface). She used her right hand to hold the interface cover open and used her left hand to
                        illuminate the buttons.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> The user then pressed the temperature “up” button and subsequently pressed
                        the temperature “down” button. As with the prior individual, this individual pressed the buttons
                        with much more force. This resulted in the buttons responding on the first press.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> The user pressed the “Fan” button until it cycled through all of the fan
                        options while the “Mode” was set to “Cool”. She paused for about 2 seconds in between each cycle
                        option.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> The user pressed the “Mode” button again and set the “Mode” to “Fan”. The
                        user then cycled through all of the fan settings again, this time taking about 1 second in
                        between each cycle option. As she cycled, she placed her hands over the air vents.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> The user then set the “Mode” to cool, set the “Fan” to its original
                        setting.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> The user checked the airflow once more, then walked away.

                            kind of hard to press, and I think it's dumb how the buttons don’t support continuous
                            pressing. The device itself did what it was supposed to do, probably would have been nicer

                <ol>
                    <li> The user approached the control panel interface, and immediately pressed the power button with
                        very little delay from the initial approach. The user did not even glance at the rest of the
                        buttons, she immediately observed the power button and focused her attention on it. Unlike other
                        users, this user pressed the button hard enough to elicit a response.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> The user then immediately pressed and held the down button on the temperature without observing
                        any of the other buttons. The control interface downshifted the temperature by one degree and
                        ceased changing.

                    <br>
                    <li> The user released the button, let out a small sigh, and manually repeatedly pushed the “down”
                        button until the temperature was set at the max low level. She was pressing the button too fast
                        for the interface to respond to each press, and so only about every second press was actually
                        registering (and causing the temperature to adjust accordingly)

                    <br>
                    <li> The user then placed her left hand over the vents to seemingly gauge the temperature of the
                        output air.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> Similarly to the prior user, this user cupped her hands over the lighting indication buttons on
                        the control panel display, leaned in, and checked what “Mode” the control interface was set to.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> The user pressed the “Fan” button three times. In between each press (all of which registered
                        on the first press) she placed her hand over the vents to evaluate the airflow.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li> The user reset the “Fan” to its original setting of “Medium” and walked away from the
                        interface.

                <h4>User Description</h4>
                <p> Frazzled Frank is a middle-aged stay-at-home father of two.
                </p>
                <p> He has two rambunctious young children, with whom he spends much of his
                    time with and frequently takes out for activities at the local recreation center and other
                    kid-friendly locations.
                </p>
                <h4>Interface Problems</h4>
                <p> Frank finds the interface very manual and tedious to use. He finds that he
                    must step through multiple steps to accomplish his objectives, and finds doing so difficult
                    while taking care of his children.
                </p>
                <p> Frank finds the buttons on the interface hard to press, as they are manual
                    (not capacitive) buttons that require a fair amount of force.
                </p>
                <p> Frank finds it annoying that the buttons on the interface must be
                    repeatedly pressed to increment the settings (i.e changing the temperature by 5 degrees requires
                    5 separate button pushes).
                </p>
                <p> Frank has a bit of trouble reading the small font sizes on the controls of
                    the device and viewing the light that reflects user selections.

            <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
                <h4>User Selection Explanation</h4>
                <p> According to Census.gov, 61.6% of men in America are fathers, and about
                    50% classify as middle-aged (early thirties to early sixties) representing a very large user
                    base for the product.
                </p>
                <p> Frank was chosen as a persona as he encapsulates a very large slice of
                    users who all exhibit similar behavior drawn upon similar life experiences and similar familial
                    dynamics.
                </p>
                <p> Frank represents the classic archetype of a middle-aged individual in
                    America. He has experience with and is fully capable of using older interfaces (as these
                    individuals have lived through and used technology of the last several decades), but much
                    prefers the ease of use associated with newer designs.
                </p>
                <p> Frank exhibits this familiarity when he quickly and efficiently tunes the
                    AC to fit his needs.
                </p>
                <p> Frank represents users who are busy, distracted, and prefer quick-response
                    interfaces that can adapt quickly using the latest tools available.

                <h4>User Description</h4>
                <p> Amy is a 16 year old female, has two siblings, has many friends, and is currently finishing up high
                    school.
                </p>
                <p> Amy grew up in the age of technology, and is familiar with the newest innovations. She doesn’t have
                    a ton of responsibilities on her plate, and enjoys hanging out with her friends (especially at her
                    local community recreation center).
                </p>
                <h4>Interface Problems</h4>
                <p> Amy finds the interface very manual and unintuitive. She has difficulty understanding how all the
                    settings tie together, and how they should be used to achieve her desired temperature.
                </p>
                <p> Amy has a hard time pressing the buttons, and finds them clunky and unresponsive to her actions. She
                    also finds the coloring distasteful.
                </p>
                <p> Amy doesn’t like how the buttons require separate pushes to increment (i.e, one needs to press the
                    “down” button five separate times to adjust the temperature down by 5 degrees).
                </p>
                <p> Amy has a difficult time reading the light that indicates what setting the unit is on, especially in
                    the brightly lit room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amy wishes the interface did not require so much close-up interaction, and could be controlled from
                    farther away.
                </p>
            </div>

                <h4>User Selection Explanation</h4>
                <p> According to Statista, Gen Z (those born in the mid 90’s to mid 2000’s) make up 21% of the
                    population.
                </p>
                <p> These individuals represent the next generation of frequent UI users, and interfaces must able to
                    satisfy their needs to be viable.
                </p>
                <p> Amy represents the archetypal Gen Z individual; She is very well-versed in technology, has an innate
                    understanding of how the newest touch and voice based UIs work, and has spent nearly the entirety of
                    her life in the midst of the technological revolution.
                </p>
                <p> Amy has a somewhat limited understanding of dated technology, and finds UI’s based on concepts from
                    earlier decades a bit more difficult to use given her lack of experience.
                </p>
                <p> Amy has a larger social network, and is often found in communal places where this AC interface is
                    located in.

                    Creating a user-friendly application using stateful programming is a skill that all designers
                    should have. This project allowed me to connect the usability principles I have learned into an
                    actual product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It pays dividends to fully flesh out the architecture of any application before coding. Even a
                    simple application such as the one above has a lot of moving parts, and it makes life infinitely
                    easier to have a clear cut plan before diving into the code.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's worth it to have redundancy in some features of an application. For example, users should
                    have the ability to add and remove items from cart from both the landing page and the shopping
                    cart page. This minimizes scrolling and makes the design as intuitive as possible.
